Install NodeJS 18+, then run:
Do NOT use sudo npm install -g as this can lead to permission issues and security risks. If you encounter permission errors, see configure Claude Code for recommended solutions.

Claude Code is an agentic coding tool that lives in your terminal, understands your codebase, and helps you code faster through natural language commands. By integrating directly with your development environment, Claude Code streamlines your workflow without requiring additional servers or complex setup.

Claude Code’s key capabilities include:

Editing files and fixing bugs across your codebase
Answering questions about your code’s architecture and logic
Executing and fixing tests, linting, and other commands
Searching through git history, resolving merge conflicts, and creating commits and PRs
Research preview

Code is in beta as a research preview. We’re gathering developer feedback on AI collaboration preferences, which workflows benefit most from AI assistance, and how to improve the agent experience.

This early version will evolve based on user feedback. We plan to enhance tool execution reliability, support for long-running commands, terminal rendering, and Claude’s self-knowledge of its capabilities in the coming weeks.

Report bugs directly with the /bug command or through our GitHub repository.

Before you begin

Check system requirements

Operating Systems: macOS 10.15+, Ubuntu 20.04+/Debian 10+, or Windows via WSL
Hardware: 4GB RAM minimum
Software:
Node.js 18+
git 2.23+ (optional)
GitHub or GitLab CLI for PR workflows (optional)
ripgrep (rg) for enhanced file search (optional)
Network: Internet connection required for authentication and AI processing
Location: Available only in supported countries
Troubleshooting WSL installation

Currently, Claude Code does not run directly in Windows, and instead requires WSL. If you encounter issues in WSL:

OS/platform detection issues: If you receive an error during installation, WSL may be using Windows npm. Try:

Run npm config set os linux before installation
Install with npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code --force --no-os-check (Do NOT use sudo)
Node not found errors: If you see exec: node: not found when running claude, your WSL environment may be using a Windows installation of Node.js. You can confirm this with which npm and which node, which should point to Linux paths starting with /usr/ rather than /mnt/c/. To fix this, try installing Node via your Linux distribution’s package manager or via nvm.

Install and authenticate

Install Claude Code

Run in your terminal: npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

Do NOT use sudo npm install -g as this can lead to permission issues and security risks. If you encounter permission errors, see configure Claude Code for recommended solutions.

Navigate to your project

cd your-project-directory

Start Claude Code

Run claude to launch

Complete authentication

Follow the one-time OAuth process with your Console account. You’ll need active billing at console.anthropic.com.

Core features and workflows

Claude Code operates directly in your terminal, understanding your project context and taking real actions. No need to manually add files to context - Claude will explore your codebase as needed. Claude Code uses claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219 by default.

Security and privacy by design

Your code’s security is paramount. Claude Code’s architecture ensures:

Direct API connection: Your queries go straight to Anthropic’s API without intermediate servers
Works where you work: Operates directly in your terminal
Understands context: Maintains awareness of your entire project structure
Takes action: Performs real operations like editing files and creating commits
From questions to solutions in seconds

Initialize your project

For first-time users, we recommend:

Start Claude Code with claude
Try a simple command like summarize this project
Generate a CLAUDE.md project guide with /init
Ask Claude to commit the generated CLAUDE.md file to your repository
Use Claude Code for common tasks

Claude Code operates directly in your terminal, understanding your project context and taking real actions. No need to manually add files to context - Claude will explore your codebase as needed.

Understand unfamiliar code

Automate Git operations

Edit code intelligently

Test and debug your code

Encourage deeper thinking

For complex problems, explicitly ask Claude to think more deeply:

Claude Code will show when Claude (3.7 Sonnet) is using extended thinking. You can proactively prompt Claude to “think” or “think deeply” for more planning-intensive tasks. We suggest that you first tell Claude about your task and let it gather context from your project. Then, ask it to “think” to create a plan.

Claude will think more based on the words you use. For example, “think hard” will trigger more extended thinking than saying “think” alone.

For more tips, see Extended thinking tips.

Automate CI and infra workflows

Claude Code comes with a non-interactive mode for headless execution. This is especially useful for running Claude Code in non-interactive contexts like scripts, pipelines, and Github Actions.

Use --print (-p) to run Claude in non-interactive mode. In this mode, you can set the ANTHROPIC_API_KEY environment variable to provide a custom API key.

Non-interactive mode is especially useful when you pre-configure the set of commands Claude is allowed to use:

Control Claude Code with commands

CLI commands

Command	Description	Example
claude	Start interactive REPL	claude
claude "query"	Start REPL with initial prompt	claude "explain this project"
claude -p "query"	Run one-off query, then exit	claude -p "explain this function"
cat file | claude -p "query"	Process piped content	cat logs.txt | claude -p "explain"
claude config	Configure settings	claude config set --global theme dark
claude update	Update to latest version	claude update
claude mcp	Configure Model Context Protocol servers	See MCP section in tutorials
CLI flags:

--print (-p): Print response without interactive mode
--json: Return JSON output in --print mode, useful for scripting and automation
--verbose: Enable verbose logging, shows full turn-by-turn output (helpful for debugging in both print and interactive modes)
--dangerously-skip-permissions: Skip permission prompts
Slash commands

Control Claude’s behavior within a session:

Command	Purpose
/bug	Report bugs (sends conversation to Anthropic)
/clear	Clear conversation history
/compact [instructions]	Compact conversation with optional focus instructions
/config	View/modify configuration
/cost	Show token usage statistics
/doctor	Checks the health of your Claude Code installation
/help	Get usage help
/init	Initialize project with CLAUDE.md guide
/login	Switch Anthropic accounts
/logout	Sign out from your Anthropic account
/memory	Edit CLAUDE.md memory files
/pr_comments	View pull request comments
/review	Request code review
/terminal-setup	Install Shift+Enter key binding for newlines (iTerm2 and VSCode only)
/vim	Enter vim mode for alternating insert and command modes
Manage Claude’s memory

Claude Code can remember your preferences across sessions, like style guidelines and common commands in your workflow.

Determine memory type

Claude Code offers three memory locations, each serving a different purpose:

Memory Type	Location	Purpose	Use Case Examples
Project memory	./CLAUDE.md	Team-shared conventions and knowledge	Project architecture, coding standards, common workflows
Project memory (local)	./CLAUDE.local.md	Personal project-specific preferences	Your sandbox URLs, preferred test data
User memory	~/.claude/CLAUDE.md	Global personal preferences	Code styling preferences, personal tooling shortcuts
All memory files are automatically loaded into Claude Code’s context when launched.

How Claude looks up memories

Claude Code reads memories recursively: starting in the cwd, Claude Code recurses up to / and reads any CLAUDE.md or CLAUDE.local.md files it finds. This is especially convenient when working in large repositories where you run Claude Code in foo/bar/, and have memories in both foo/CLAUDE.md and foo/bar/CLAUDE.md.

Quickly add memories with the # shortcut

The fastest way to add a memory is to start your input with the # character:

You’ll be prompted to select which memory file to store this in.

Directly edit memories with /memory

Use the /memory slash command during a session to open any memory file in your system editor for more extensive additions or organization.

Memory best practices

Be specific: “Use 2-space indentation” is better than “Format code properly”.
Use structure to organize: Format each individual memory as a bullet point and group related memories under descriptive markdown headings.
Review periodically: Update memories as your project evolves to ensure Claude is always using the most up to date information and context.
Manage permissions and security

Claude Code uses a tiered permission system to balance power and safety:

Tool Type	Example	Approval Required	”Yes, don’t ask again” Behavior
Read-only	File reads, LS, Grep	No	N/A
Bash Commands	Shell execution	Yes	Permanently per project directory and command
File Modification	Edit/write files	Yes	Until session end
Tools available to Claude

Claude Code has access to a set of powerful tools that help it understand and modify your codebase:

Tool	Description	Permission Required
AgentTool	Runs a sub-agent to handle complex, multi-step tasks	No
BashTool	Executes shell commands in your environment	Yes
GlobTool	Finds files based on pattern matching	No
GrepTool	Searches for patterns in file contents	No
LSTool	Lists files and directories	No
FileReadTool	Reads the contents of files	No
FileEditTool	Makes targeted edits to specific files	Yes
FileWriteTool	Creates or overwrites files	Yes
NotebookReadTool	Reads and displays Jupyter notebook contents	No
NotebookEditTool	Modifies Jupyter notebook cells	Yes
Permission rules

You can manage Claude Code’s allowed tools with /allowed-tools.

Your personal project permission settings are saved in your global Claude config (in ~/.claude.json).

Shared project permissions are loaded from .claude/settings.json when Claude Code is launched. These settings are shared across everyone working with this code so that each user doesn’t have to configure commonly used safe tools.

Example .claude/settings.json

Permission rules use the format: Tool(optional-specifier)

For example, adding WebFetchTool to the list of allow rules would allow any use of the web fetch tool without requiring user approval. Some tools have more fine-grained controls to allow specific tool invocations without user approval. See the table below for examples.

MCP tool names follow the format: mcp__server_name__tool_name, where:

server_name is the name of the MCP server as configured in Claude Code
tool_name is the specific tool provided by that server
Rule	Description
Bash(npm run build)	Matches the exact Bash command npm run build.
Bash(npm run test:*)	Matches Bash commands starting with npm run test. See note below about command separator handling.
mcp__puppeteer__puppeteer_navigate	Matches the puppeteer_navigate tool from the puppeteer MCP server.
WebFetchTool(domain:example.com)	Matches fetch requests to example.com
Claude Code is aware of command separators (like &&) so a prefix match rule like Bash(safe-cmd:*) won’t give it permission to run the command safe-cmd && other-cmd

Protect against prompt injection

Prompt injection is a technique where an attacker attempts to override or manipulate an AI assistant’s instructions by inserting malicious text. Claude Code includes several safeguards against these attacks:

Permission system: Sensitive operations require explicit approval
Context-aware analysis: Detects potentially harmful instructions by analyzing the full request
Input sanitization: Prevents command injection by processing user inputs
Command blocklist: Blocks risky commands that fetch arbitrary content from the web like curl and wget
Best practices for working with untrusted content:

Review suggested commands before approval
Avoid piping untrusted content directly to Claude
Verify proposed changes to critical files
Report suspicious behavior with /bug
While these protections significantly reduce risk, no system is completely immune to all attacks. Always maintain good security practices when working with any AI tool.

Configure network access

Claude Code requires access to:

api.anthropic.com
statsig.anthropic.com
sentry.io
Allowlist these URLs when using Claude Code in containerized environments.

Environment variables

Claude Code supports the following environment variables to control its behavior:

Variable	Purpose
DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER	Set to 1 to disable the automatic updater
DISABLE_BUG_COMMAND	Set to 1 to disable the /bug command
DISABLE_COST_WARNINGS	Set to 1 to disable cost warning messages
HTTP_PROXY	Specify HTTP proxy server for network connections
HTTPS_PROXY	Specify HTTPS proxy server for network connections
MCP_TIMEOUT	Timeout in milliseconds for MCP server startup
MCP_TOOL_TIMEOUT	Timeout in milliseconds for MCP tool execution
Configure Claude Code

Configure Claude Code by running claude config in your terminal, or the /config command when using the interactive REPL.

Configuration options

Claude Code supports global and project-level configuration.

To manage your configurations, use the following commands:

List settings: claude config list
See a setting: claude config get <key>
Change a setting: claude config set <key> <value>
Push to a setting (for lists): claude config add <key> <value>
Remove from a setting (for lists): claude config remove <key> <value>
By default config changes your project configuration. To manage your global configuration, use the --global (or -g) flag.

Global configuration

To set a global configuration, use claude config set -g <key> <value>:

Key	Value	Description
autoUpdaterStatus	disabled or enabled	Enable or disable the auto-updater (default: enabled)
env	JSON (eg. '{"FOO": "bar"}')	Environment variables that will be applied to every session
preferredNotifChannel	iterm2, iterm2_with_bell, terminal_bell, or notifications_disabled	Where you want to receive notifications (default: iterm2)
theme	dark, light, light-daltonized, or dark-daltonized	Color theme
verbose	true or false	Whether to show full bash and command outputs (default: false)
Auto-updater permission options

When Claude Code detects that it doesn’t have sufficient permissions to write to your global npm prefix directory (required for automatic updates), you’ll see a warning that points to this documentation page. For detailed solutions to auto-updater issues, see the troubleshooting guide.

Recommended: Create a new user-writable npm prefix

Why we recommend this option:

Avoids modifying system directory permissions
Creates a clean, dedicated location for your global npm packages
Follows security best practices
Since Claude Code is actively developing, we recommend setting up auto-updates using the recommended option above.

Disabling the auto-updater

If you prefer to disable the auto-updater instead of fixing permissions, you can use:

Project configuration

Manage project configuration with claude config set <key> <value> (without the -g flag):

Key	Value	Description
allowedTools	array of tools	Which tools can run without manual approval
ignorePatterns	array of glob strings	Which files/directories are ignored when using tools
For example:

See Permission rules for the allowedTools rule format.

Optimize your terminal setup

Claude Code works best when your terminal is properly configured. Follow these guidelines to optimize your experience.

Supported shells:

Bash
Zsh
Fish
Themes and appearance

Claude cannot control the theme of your terminal. That’s handled by your terminal application. You can match Claude Code’s theme to your terminal during onboarding or any time via the /config command

Line breaks

You have several options for entering linebreaks into Claude Code:

Quick escape: Type \ followed by Enter to create a newline
Keyboard shortcut: Press Option+Enter (Meta+Enter) with proper configuration
To set up Option+Enter in your terminal:

For Mac Terminal.app:

Open Settings → Profiles → Keyboard
Check “Use Option as Meta Key”
For iTerm2 and VSCode terminal:

Open Settings → Profiles → Keys
Under General, set Left/Right Option key to “Esc+”
Tip for iTerm2 and VSCode users: Run /terminal-setup within Claude Code to automatically configure Shift+Enter as a more intuitive alternative.

Notification setup

Never miss when Claude completes a task with proper notification configuration:

Terminal bell notifications

Enable sound alerts when tasks complete:

For macOS users: Don’t forget to enable notification permissions in System Settings → Notifications → [Your Terminal App].

iTerm 2 system notifications

For iTerm 2 alerts when tasks complete:

Open iTerm 2 Preferences
Navigate to Profiles → Terminal
Enable “Silence bell” and “Send notification when idle”
Set your preferred notification delay
Note that these notifications are specific to iTerm 2 and not available in the default macOS Terminal.

Handling large inputs

When working with extensive code or long instructions:

Avoid direct pasting: Claude Code may struggle with very long pasted content
Use file-based workflows: Write content to a file and ask Claude to read it
Be aware of VS Code limitations: The VS Code terminal is particularly prone to truncating long pastes
Vim Mode

Claude Code supports a subset of Vim keybindings that can be enabled with /vim or configured via /config.

The supported subset includes:

Mode switching: Esc (to NORMAL), i/I, a/A, o/O (to INSERT)
Navigation: h/j/k/l, w/e/b, 0/$/^, gg/G
Editing: x, dw/de/db/dd/D, cw/ce/cb/cc/C, . (repeat)
Manage costs effectively

Claude Code consumes tokens for each interaction. The average cost is $6 per developer per day, with daily costs remaining below $12 for 90% of users.

Track your costs

Use /cost to see current session usage
Check historical usage in the Anthropic Console. Note: Users need Admin or Billing roles to view Cost tab
Set workspace spend limits for the Claude Code workspace. Note: Users need Admin role to set spend limits.
Reduce token usage

Compact conversations:

Claude uses auto-compact by default when context exceeds 95% capacity

Toggle auto-compact: Run /config and navigate to “Auto-compact enabled”

Use /compact manually when context gets large

Add custom instructions: /compact Focus on code samples and API usage

Customize compaction by adding to CLAUDE.md:

Write specific queries: Avoid vague requests that trigger unnecessary scanning

Break down complex tasks: Split large tasks into focused interactions

Clear history between tasks: Use /clear to reset context

Costs can vary significantly based on:

Size of codebase being analyzed
Complexity of queries
Number of files being searched or modified
Length of conversation history
Frequency of compacting conversations
For team deployments, we recommend starting with a small pilot group to establish usage patterns before wider rollout.

Model configuration

By default, Claude Code uses claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219. You can override this using the following environment variables:

You can also set these variables using the global configuration:

See our model names reference for all available models across different providers.

Use with third-party APIs

Claude Code requires access to both Claude 3.7 Sonnet and Claude 3.5 Haiku models, regardless of which API provider you use.

Connect to Amazon Bedrock

If you’d like to access Claude Code via proxy, you can use the ANTHROPIC_BEDROCK_BASE_URL environment variable:

If you don’t have prompt caching enabled, also set:

Requires standard AWS SDK credentials (e.g., ~/.aws/credentials or relevant environment variables like AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY). To set up AWS credentials, run:

Contact Amazon Bedrock for prompt caching for reduced costs and higher rate limits.

Users will need access to both Claude 3.7 Sonnet and Claude 3.5 Haiku models in their AWS account. If you have a model access role, you may need to request access to these models if they’re not already available. Access to Bedrock in each region is necessary because inference profiles require cross-region capability.

Connect to Google Vertex AI

If you’d like to access Claude Code via proxy, you can use the ANTHROPIC_VERTEX_BASE_URL environment variable:

If you don’t have prompt caching enabled, also set:

Claude Code on Vertex AI currently only supports the us-east5 region. Make sure your project has quota allocated in this specific region.

Users will need access to both Claude 3.7 Sonnet and Claude 3.5 Haiku models in their Vertex AI project.

Requires standard GCP credentials configured through google-auth-library. To set up GCP credentials, run:

For the best experience, contact Google for heightened rate limits.

Connect though a proxy

When using Claude Code with an LLM proxy (like LiteLLM), you can control authentication behavior using the following environment variables and configs. Note that you can mix and match these with Bedrock and Vertex-specific settings.

Environment variables

ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN: Custom value for the Authorization and Proxy-Authorization headers (the value you set here will be prefixed with Bearer )
ANTHROPIC_CUSTOM_HEADERS: Custom headers you want to add to the request (in Name: Value format)
HTTP_PROXY: Set the HTTP proxy URL
HTTPS_PROXY: Set the HTTPS proxy URL
If you prefer to configure via a file instead of environment variables, you can add any of these variables to the env object in your global Claude config (in ~/.claude.json).

Global configuration options

apiKeyHelper: A custom shell script to get an API key (invoked once at startup, and cached for the duration of each session)
Development container reference implementation

Claude Code provides a development container configuration for teams that need consistent, secure environments. This preconfigured devcontainer setup works seamlessly with VS Code’s Remote - Containers extension and similar tools.

The container’s enhanced security measures (isolation and firewall rules) allow you to run claude --dangerously-skip-permissions to bypass permission prompts for unattended operation. We’ve included a reference implementation that you can customize for your needs.

While the devcontainer provides substantial protections, no system is completely immune to all attacks. Always maintain good security practices and monitor Claude’s activities.

Key features

Production-ready Node.js: Built on Node.js 20 with essential development dependencies
Security by design: Custom firewall restricting network access to only necessary services
Developer-friendly tools: Includes git, ZSH with productivity enhancements, fzf, and more
Seamless VS Code integration: Pre-configured extensions and optimized settings
Session persistence: Preserves command history and configurations between container restarts
Works everywhere: Compatible with macOS, Windows, and Linux development environments
Getting started in 4 steps

Install VS Code and the Remote - Containers extension
Clone the Claude Code reference implementation repository
Open the repository in VS Code
When prompted, click “Reopen in Container” (or use Command Palette: Cmd+Shift+P → “Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container”)
Configuration breakdown

The devcontainer setup consists of three primary components:

devcontainer.json: Controls container settings, extensions, and volume mounts
Dockerfile: Defines the container image and installed tools
init-firewall.sh: Establishes network security rules
Security features

The container implements a multi-layered security approach with its firewall configuration:

Precise access control: Restricts outbound connections to whitelisted domains only (npm registry, GitHub, Anthropic API, etc.)
Default-deny policy: Blocks all other external network access
Startup verification: Validates firewall rules when the container initializes
Isolation: Creates a secure development environment separated from your main system
Customization options

The devcontainer configuration is designed to be adaptable to your needs:

Add or remove VS Code extensions based on your workflow
Modify resource allocations for different hardware environments
Adjust network access permissions
Customize shell configurations and developer tooling
