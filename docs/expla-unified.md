Explanation of the Unified Framework
This UnifiedFractalFramework.jl module serves as a parent library that integrates the functionalities of both code and communication analysis frameworks. Here's a breakdown of its design and features:
Shared Core Components:
Core structs like FractalAnalysis, Response, and TherapeuticTags are defined at the top level to ensure consistency across domains.
Fractal transformation and pattern detection functions (adapted from EnhancedFractalFramework.jl in the custom instructions) are included as the analytical engine for both submodules.
Submodule Structure:
CodeAnalysis encapsulates the functionality from FractalCodeAnalysis_Workflow_Claude.jl, focusing on codebase analysis with Claude Code integration.
CommunicationAnalysis incorporates elements from FractalCommunicationFramework_Extended.jl, focusing on conceptual and interdisciplinary communication analysis with user examples.
Unified Interface:
analyze_with_framework serves as the core analysis function used by both submodules, ensuring consistent application of fractal methodologies.
generate_fractal_report provides a unified reporting mechanism that can be tailored to either code or communication domains.
Accessibility:
Key functions from submodules are re-exported at the top level, allowing users to access analyze_codebase or analyze_communication directly from the UnifiedFractalFramework module.
This structure allows users to apply fractal methodologies to both codebases and communication contexts within a single toolset, reducing duplication and enhancing interoperability. You can extend this further by adding more user examples, refining pattern detection algorithms, or integrating visualization tools for fractal patterns.
If you'd like to refine any specific part of this module or test it with a specific use case, let me know, and I can assist further.
